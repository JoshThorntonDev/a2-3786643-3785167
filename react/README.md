Libraries Used: Bootstrap, React-Bootstrap, React-Router-Dom and React-Bootstrap-Icons

These libraries were mostly used for styling and layout purposes, with the exception of React-Router-Dom which was used for routing and navigation purposes.

Instructions for running the app are the same as any typical react app,
(npm install, npm start). Upon opening the app, you will start at the landing page, and can then access the login or sign up pages from the navbar. After logging in, the other site features will be visible in the navbar (profile, creating/viewing posts)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
